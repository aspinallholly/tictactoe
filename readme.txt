##################### TIC-TAC-TOE - README #####################

The game is comprised of three separate files - Indiv_functions.py, Rows.py, and Mainfile.py.

All files will need to be downloaded and stored within the same directory.

The former file has each function required for the game to work - this incorporates the function to validate user input, 
to translate a number to a position on the grid, and to determine who has won or if there is a tie.

Rows.py is separate purely for tidiness reasons and stores the sample grid (with numbers) and the playable tic-tac-toe
grid.

Mainfile is the file which has the 'game' function and this is the file that needs to be run when playing the game.

If there are any issues with the game then let me know.

Happy tic-tac-toeing!
